## üß† How It Works

1. **Input**: Users provide a question, ideal answer, and student answer (text or PDF)
2. **Super Intelligent Analysis**: 
   - AI analyzes the question to understand what the factually correct answer should be
   - Verifies if the teacher's ideal answer is factually correct
   - If ideal answer is wrong, AI alerts the teacher and provides the factually correct answer
   - Evaluates student's answer based on factual accuracy, not just comparison with ideal answer
3. **Results**: Platform displays score, feedback, mistakes, strengths, and any ideal answer corrections
4. **Reset**: Users can evaluate new answers (no data persistence)

## ü§ñ Super Intelligence Examples

- **Math Analysis**: Question "1+1?" - AI knows answer is "2". If teacher puts "4" as ideal but student says "2", AI flags teacher error and gives student full marks
- **Geography Intelligence**: Question "Capital of France?" - AI knows answer is "Paris". If teacher puts "London" but student says "Paris", AI corrects teacher and rewards student
- **Science Knowledge**: Question "What is H2O?" - AI knows answer is "Water". If teacher puts "Carbon Dioxide" but student says "Water", AI detects teacher error and gives student full credit
- **Critical Thinking**: AI doesn't just compare answers - it understands the question and evaluates based on factual accuracy
- **Universal Knowledge**: Works across all subjects with PhD-level expertise to catch any factual errors
